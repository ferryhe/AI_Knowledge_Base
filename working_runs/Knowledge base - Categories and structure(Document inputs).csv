In this tutorial we exemplify the proposal of. We embed a classical generalized linear model into a neural network architecture, and we let this nested network approach explore model structure not captured by the classical generalized linear model. In addition, if the generalized linear model is already close to optimal, then the maximum likelihood estimator of the generalized linear model can be used as initialization of the fitting algorithm of the neural network. This saves computational time because we start the fitting algorithm in a reasonable parameter. As a by-product of our derivations, we present embedding layers and representation learning which often provides a more efficient treatment of categorical features within neural networks than dummy and one-hot encoding.",1/22/2019,,,"J¨urg Schelldorfer,

Unsupervised learning methods are techniques that aim at reducing the dimension of data (covariables, features), cluster cases with similar features, and graphically illustrate high dimensional data. These techniques do not consider response variables, but they are solely based on the features themselves by studying incorporated similarities. For this reason, these methods belong to the field of unsupervised learning methods. The methods studied in this tutorial comprise principal components analysis (PCA) and bottleneck neural networks (BNNs) for dimension reduction, K-means clustering, K-medoids clustering, partitioning around medoids (PAM) algorithm and clustering with Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) for clustering, and variational autoencoder (VAE), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), self-organizing maps (SOM) and Kohonen maps for visualizing high dimensional data.",10/9/2019,,,"Simon Rentzmann,

The first approach is based on ‘bag-of-’ models, the second one on word embeddings, while the third one introduces the two most popular Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), i.e. the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures. We apply all approaches on a case study where we classify movie reviews using Python and Tensorflow 2.0. The results of the case study show that extreme gradient boosting algorithms outperform adaptive boosting and random forests on bag-of-words and word embedding models, as well as LSTM and GRU RNNs, but at a steep computational cost.

CNNs are particularly well suited to find common spatial structure in images or time series. As an insurance related example for life & health insurance we illustrate how to use a CNN to detect anomalies in mortality rates taken from the Human Mortality Database (HMD); the anomalies are caused by migration between countries and other errors. As a second example, we study a CNN to classify images of handwritten digits taken from one of the most widely used benchmark datasets, the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset.

These models ideally exploit given feature information to enhance the accuracy of prediction. This user guide revisits and clarifies statistical techniques to assess the calibration or adequacy of a model on the one hand, and to compare and rank different models on the other hand. In doing so, it emphasises the importance of specifying the prediction target functional at hand a priori (e.g. the mean or a quantile) and of choosing the scoring function in model comparison in line with this target functional. Guidance for the practical choice of the scoring function is provided. Striving to bridge the gap between science and daily practice in application, it focuses mainly on the pedagogical presentation of existing results and of best practice. The results are accompanied and illustrated by two real data case studies on workers’ compensation and customer churn.",7/27/2023,,,"Tobias Fissler,

,Actuarial applications of natural language processing using transformers: Case studies for using text features in an actuarial context,AI in actuarial Science,Natural language processing; transformer; multilingual models; domain-specific fine-tuning; integrated gradients; extractive question answering; zero-shot classification; topic modelling,"This paper demonstrates workflows to incorporate text data into actuarial classification and regression tasks. The main focus is on methods employing transformer-based models. A dataset of car accident descriptions with an average length of 400 words, available in English and German, and a dataset with short property insurance claims descriptions, are used to demonstrate these techniques. The case studies tackle challenges related to a multilingual setting and long input sequences. They also show ways to interpret model output and to assess and improve model performance, by fine-tuning the models to the domain of application or to a specific prediction task. Finally, the paper provides practical approaches to handle classification tasks in situations with no or only few labelled data. The results achieved by using the language-understanding skills of off-the-shelf natural language processing (NLP) models with only minimal pre-processing and fine-tuning clearly demonstrate the power of transfer learning for practical applications",3/7/2024,,,"Andreas Troxler,

and it is also used in actuarial science for evaluating insurance pricing models. The purpose
of this tutorial is to discuss the Gini index, both its version in economics and its version
in machine learning, which differ. We discuss its relationship to the area under the curve
(AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, which is often used for model
selection in binary classification problems. A main deficiency of the Gini index is that it
does not give us a consistent scoring function. Therefore, simply maximizing the Gini index
may lead to wrong decisions. The issue is that the Gini index is a rank-based score that
is not calibration-sensitive. However, if we use the Gini index for scoring within the class
of auto-calibrated regression models, it gives us a strictly consistent scoring function and,
henceforth, a sensible model selection tool. This will be discussed in this tutorial.",10/14/2022,,,"Christian Lorentzen, Michael Mayer,

It discusses how to run models on data from potentially multiple data providers without any data

requiring large amounts of sensitive personal data, and in the context of strict regulations like GDPR
in the European Union, this topic is highly relevant. We introduce the concept of (multiparty)
homomorphic encryption and demonstrate the approach on two synthetic datasets of personal health
information. Furthermore, this tutorial also provides an introduction into the most common (survival)
